          <p>
            While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across natural language generation tasks, their ability to generate truly creative content‚Äîcharacterized by novelty, diversity, surprise, and quality‚Äîremains limited. Existing methods for enhancing LLM creativity often focus narrowly on diversity or specific tasks, failing to address creativity's multifaceted nature in a generalizable way. In this work, we propose Creative Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of several models using CrPO and MuCE (Multi-task Creativity Evaluation), a new large-scale human preference dataset spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30 psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines, including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising output quality.

        <h3 class="subtitle is-5">We multiply the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss with a weighted combination of creativity scores corresponding to well-established dimensions from creativity research‚Äînovelty, surprise, diversity, and quality‚Äîwhich are frequently identified as core components in both cognitive psychology and computational creativity literature.

        <h2 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 20px;">Novelty</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle is-6">We use a novelty metric similar to Karampiperis et al. (2014) where the novelty of a preferred response is defined as the absolute difference between the average pairwise semantic distances of words in the given preferred response and those of the set of preferred responses.

        <h3 class="subtitle is-6">We use Shannon surprise - the negative log-likelihood of the preferred response under some model S ‚Äî which has been widely used as a measure of surprise in prior work (Modirshanechi et al., 2022).

                  In the garden of the mind, where pathways intertwine,  <br/>Lies the seed of choice, a subtle, silent sign.  <br/>Branches reach for sky or burrow deep in earth,  <br/>Each decision whispers secrets of its worth.<br/><br/>A river's fork, where currents twist and bend,  <br/>Flows into futures unknown, around each hidden bend.  <br/>The heart is both compass and the map unrolled,  <br/>In choices made, destinies unfold.<br/><br/>Morning light on dewdrops, shimmering with grace,  <br/>Reflects the myriad paths we each must face.  <br/>Some lead to sunlit meadows, others shadowed glen,  <br/>Yet all are steps upon the journey of what might have been.<br/><br/>Listen to the rustle of the leaves in gentle breeze,  <br/>Each a testament to choices whispered through the trees.  <br/>A symphony of echoes from the paths we leave behind,  <br/>Resonates in harmony within the corridors of mind.<br/><br/>For every choice is a painting on the canvas of the soul,  <br/>A brushstroke that defines us, making us whole.  <br/>With every heartbeat, a new choice is born,  <br/>In the tapestry of life, we are both the weaver and the worn.<br/><br/>So stand at the crossroads, fear not the unknown,  <br/>For the path you choose is the one you own.  <br/>With courage as your guide, step boldly into the light,  <br/>For choice is the dawn, breaking the endless night.
